# -COVID-19-Global-Data-Tracker-
A polished, run-ready Jupyter Notebook that follows your 6-step process (Data Loading → Cleaning → EDA → Vaccination visuals → Choropleth → Insights).
Auto-detection and a simple column-mapping step so you can adapt if your CSV uses different column names.
Clear Markdown sections and instructions so the notebook reads like a professional report.
Interactive Plotly choropleth (optional) and matplotlib/seaborn charts.
