# -COVID-19-Global-Data-Tracker-
A polished, run-ready Jupyter Notebook that follows your 6-step process (Data Loading → Cleaning → EDA → Vaccination visuals → Choropleth → Insights).
Auto-detection and a simple column-mapping step so you can adapt if your CSV uses different column names.
Clear Markdown sections and instructions so the notebook reads like a professional report.
Interactive Plotly choropleth (optional) and matplotlib/seaborn charts.
Download the notebook and open it in Jupyter/JupyterLab.

Run cells from top to bottom. If your CSV uses different column names for date, location, etc., update the mapping in the "Data Cleaning" cell.

Edit the countries list in the cleaning cell to choose which countries to analyze.

If you want, I can:

Customize the notebook to analyze specific countries you pick.

Add a summary PDF export cell that programmatically converts the notebook to PDF (requires nbconvert + LaTeX).

Convert the notebook into a Streamlit dashboard.
